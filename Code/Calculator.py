# The Solar Car Calculator SCC is able to calculate the rentability of an electric camper van with solar cells on the rooftop compared to a conventional camper van using fossil fuels.
# It is expected that the electric camper is much more expensive, but cheaper in the upkeep since electricity is generated on the roof and maintenance is cheaper.
# The author thinks that the rentability mainly depends on the personal usage profile, e.g. the time and the amount of sunshine in his local area between drives. This calculator aims
# at answering this question with irradiation data from the German Weather Service DWD and google movement tracking that the author gathered in the last half year while driving his
# conventional camper van.
